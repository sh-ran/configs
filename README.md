## Configs for my Linux machine.

This repo maintains both my configs for my i3 and hyprland setup.

- Alacritty is my go to terminal emulator. It just works out of the box for me and needs minimal configuration.
- Backgrounds has all my wallpapers that I use regularly.
- Dunst is a notification daemon for my i3 setup.
- Hypr contains all my configs for hyprland setup.
- i3 contains all my configs for my i3 setup.
- i3status is configured to show basic stuff that I need.
- kitty why kitty? I tried. It was not for me.
- nvim has all my nvim configs although I normally use code. Will be moving to nvim soon tho.
- picom configured to make my i3/xorg setup look a bit good.
- polybar for my i3 setup.
- rofi for both my i3 and hyprland setups.
- tmux dont use it that much, but configured idk why.
- waybar small changes to theprimeagen's waybar config. (too lazy to make my own and his looked cool anyway. Sue me)
- zed configured but I dont use zed. Just keeping a copy of the settings for the future.
- Xmodmap to change my `CAPS` to `ctrl` in my i3 setup.
- zshrc run `mv zshrc ~/.zshrc` to change your current zsh config with this.
